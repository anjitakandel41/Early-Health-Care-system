Chronic cholestasis,This condition results from impaired bile flow leading to jaundice and itching. Ursodeoxycholic acid is prescribed to improve bile flow along with vitamin supplementation.
Drug Reaction,Drug reactions range from mild rashes to severe allergic responses to medications. Immediate cessation of the drug and use of antihistamines or corticosteroids is essential.
